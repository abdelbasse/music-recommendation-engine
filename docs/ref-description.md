# How the Music Industry Actually Works ðŸŽµ

## 1. ARTIST TYPES & RELATIONSHIPS

### **Solo Artists**
- **Example**: Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Drake
- One person is the "brand" and creative force
- May work with producers, songwriters, but they're the main artist

### **Bands/Groups**
- **Example**: Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead, BTS
- Multiple permanent members
- Usually have a "lead" person but all are considered the artist

### **Collaborations (Features)**
- **Example**: "Stay" by The Kid LAROI **featuring** Justin Bieber
- Main artist + featured artist(s)
- Featured artist is credited but not the primary

### **Supergroups/Temporary Groups**
- **Example**: Boygenius (Phoebe Bridgers + Lucy Dacus + Julien Baker)
- Established solo artists forming a group
- May be temporary or permanent

### **Producer-Artists**
- **Example**: Calvin Harris, Diplo, Skrillex
- Producers who become artists themselves
- Often collaborate with vocalists

      "members": 1,
      "example": "Ed Sheeran"
    },

```

### **Album Type Complexities:**

## 6. DATA PIPELINE RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Priority 1: Flexible Artist Relationships**
```sql
-- Don't just have "artist_id" - have artist roles
CREATE TABLE track_artists (
    track_id UUID,
    artist_id UUID,
    role ENUM('primary', 'featured', 'producer', 'songwriter'),
    credit_order INT,
    percentage_split DECIMAL(5,2)
);
```

### **Priority 2: Hierarchical Genres**
```sql
-- Genre inheritance system
CREATE TABLE genres (
    genre_id UUID,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_genre_id UUID,
    level INT, -- 0=root, 1=main, 2=sub, 3=micro
    fusion_components JSON -- ["rock", "electronic"] for electro-rock
);
```

### **Priority 3: Time-Based Changes**
```sql
-- Artists and genres evolve over time
CREATE TABLE artist_evolution (
    artist_id UUID,
    time_period VARCHAR(20), -- "2010-2015"
    primary_genre VARCHAR(50),
    style_description TEXT,
    influences JSON
);
```

### **Priority 4: Complex Credit Tracking**
```sql
-- Track all the people involved
CREATE TABLE track_credits (
    track_id UUID,
    person_id UUID,
    role ENUM('vocalist', 'guitarist', 'producer', 'songwriter', 'engineer'),
    contribution_detail TEXT,
    royalty_percentage DECIMAL(5,2)
);
```

## 7. BUSINESS LOGIC FOR YOUR PIPELINE

### **When Processing New Music:**

1. **Identify Primary vs Featured Artists**
   - Look for "feat.", "featuring", "ft.", "with"
   - Primary gets main credit, featured gets secondary

2. **Handle Genre Classification**
   - Use multiple genres per track
   - Track genre confidence levels
   - Consider time period and geographic context

3. **Credit Assignment**
   - Separate performers from creators
   - Track producer vs songwriter vs artist
   - Handle percentage splits for royalties

4. **Album Context**
   - Is this a solo album, band album, or compilation?
   - Are there multiple primary artists?
   - Is this part of a larger project (soundtrack, etc.)?

### **Recommendation Engine Implications:**
- **Similar Artists**: Based on collaborations, not just genres
- **Genre Evolution**: Track how listener tastes change over time
- **Context Matters**: Same artist in different contexts (solo vs band)
- **Credit Network**: Recommend based on producer/songwriter connections

This complexity is why services like Spotify have teams of music experts manually curating and verifying data - it's not just about algorithms!
